Project Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to design a database that consolidates and organizes information about the operation of a chain of second-hand auto shops present in various localities throughout the Oltenia region. The aim is to enhance the management of inventory, customer and supplier relationships, as well as the events and activities of the auto shops. This database will serve as an essential tool for tracking a multitude of operational aspects, including vehicle stock, parking spaces, types of vehicles, parts, materials, clients, vehicle providers (whether individuals or companies), parts suppliers, service centers, and promotional events (such as periodic demonstrations, raffles, lotteries, etc.). It will also cover car accessories (such as trailers, covers, caravans, bike or motorcycle racks, etc.), records of purchased and sold vehicles, characteristic activities of auto shops, including financial details, and more.
For additional details regarding the presentation, please refer to the attached Word document. This document contains comprehensive information that elaborates on the specific requirements and functionalities of the database system. The document is a formal exposition on the structure, relationships, and management of data pertaining to the chain of second-hand auto shops, their operations, and the wide array of associated entities within the Oltenia region. It provides in-depth insight into the envisioned database architecture and its role in facilitating efficient business processes and decision-making.
